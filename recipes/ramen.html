<h2>Description</h2>
<p>One of the main obstacles for people going vegan is money. Whole foods are expensive and vegan substitutes are even more expensive. One of the ways I've tried to combat the cost of veganism is by taking my college student diet and veganizing it. Ramen was one of my favorite dishes to play with because it's so versatile and can be as affordable as you need it to be!</p>
<p>For this recipe, I used fresh Swiss Chard and some Miso Broth to class the dish up a bit and give it some extra flavor and nutrition. However, most leafy greens will work! Kale, Bok Choy, Swiss Chard, and grilled veggies are some of my favorite ramen add-ons.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 oz ginger</li>
    <li>2 tbsp white miso paste</li>
    <li>5.5 oz coconut milk</li>
    <li>1 tbsp tamari</li>
    <li>6 oz broccolini</li>
    <li>4 oz Swiss chard</li>
    <li>1 lemon</li>
    <li>10 oz fresh ramen noodles</li>
    <li>2 tbsp chili garlic sauce</li>
    <li>2 tsp smoked nori spice</li>
    <li>1 tsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Slice ginger into rounds. Add white miso paste, coconut milk, tamari, 3 cups water, and a pinch of salt to a medium saucepan. Bring the miso coconut broth to a boil over medium-high heat and whisk to dissolve the miso paste. Add sliced ginger, reduce heat to low, and let simmer.</li>
    <li>Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to a boil for the ramen. Trim 1 inch off broccolini stems, and chop broccolini into 2 inch pieces. Roughly chop the Swiss chard. Halve the lemon, juice one half, and divide the other half into wedges. Thinly slice radishes into rounds.</li>
    <li>Transfer the chopped broccolini to a baking sheet and toss with 1 tsp vegetable oil and a pinch of salt. Roast until stems are lightly charred, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add chopped Swiss chard to the miso coconut broth and stir. Continue to simmer until just wilted, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add ramen noodles to the boiling water and cook until just al dente, 1 to 2 minutes. Drain noodles and run under cool water to stop the cooking process.</li>
    <li>Add lemon juice to the miso coconut broth. Taste, and add salt as necessary. Divide ramen noodles between two deep bowls. Top with coconut miso broth, charred broccolini, sliced radish, and chili garlic sauce. Sprinkle smoked nori spice over both bowls. Serve with lemon wedges. Enjoy!</li>
