<h2>Description</h2>
<p>One of the main obstacles for people going vegan is money. Whole foods are expensive and vegan substitutes are even more expensive. One of the ways I've tried to combat the cost of veganism is by taking my college student diet and veganizing it. Ramen was one of my favorite dishes to play with because it's so versatile and can be as affordable as you need it to be!</p>
<p>For this recipe, I used fresh Swiss Chard and some Miso Broth to class the dish up a bit and give it some extra flavor and nutrition. However, most leafy greens will work! Kale, Bok Choy, Swiss Chard, and grilled veggies are some of my favorite ramen add-ons.</p>
